Greg Grant,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,19 Nov 2021,"Legalised theftAirbnb refund policy is a sham, as is their claim to value customer safety and security. They give hosts your phone and email then refuse to acknowledge their unreasonable and dishonest statements because it's not ""valid"" evidence when made off-app. So why provide them with Guest contact details and encourage you to phone/message after booking? They also won't say whether negative reviews for this property have been hidden, which I suspect they have been. Why? Because less people would book and less money for them. Customer service is basically a process of agents being assigned your case then telling you that they are on holiday and will contact you in a few days but they don't. This has happened 10+ times now, so it's clearly a designed system to mug off consumers. Avoid, avoid, avoid.I will be taking them to court if I don't get a refund."
David,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,18 Nov 2021,"Awful, awful company. Their service and complaints centre is so poor. I've only used AirBNB a few times, but I've had so much trouble in cancelled bookings and scammers not giving refunds back. Avoid."
Leanne Matthews,IM,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,13 Nov 2021,"Absolutely shocking service. No protection for people booking with them. Refunds are ‘at the host discretion’ even when there are clearly big issues with a property not being as described and the host accused us of planting stuff when we complained about the cleanliness (because I always carry bags of dust around with me). Air BNB said the host provided pictures to prove it was clean. No idea how they were more compelling than pictures we provided to show the opposite, which can only have been taken on the day we arrived as we left the following morning.Air BNB also won’t publish your review of a property without it going to the host for them to review you too and somehow, despite lots of reviews mentioning issues and cleanliness, the property had a high rating so this is clearly manipulated.I’ll never use Air BNB again. Waste of time."
JanetteG,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,3 Nov 2021,"Wish I could give minus starsI feel very let down by Airbnb and the host Craig from Beattock. I booked and paid for a weeks holiday which was subsequently cancelled by the host with less than 24 hours notice, due to previous renters having broke the boiler. I was promised a full refund which when it finally arrived I found I had been underpaid £155.70. I raised this with both the host and Airbnb and have just been informed Airbnb can’t get involved as the host paid the refund direct. Why should I be out of pocket through no fault of my own! First time booking with this site never again!!!!!!"
MR YESUBABU POTHINENI,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,29 Oct 2021,"Booked a cottage through Airbnb in Aug 2021 along with Ferry etc. A day before the start date, got an email from the cottage owner saying that the accommodation has been cancelled,  Then booked another flat through Airbnb immediately ( a lot expensive than original booking).  Just an hour before the check in start time, got an email from the flat owner saying that unfortunately they can't provide the accommodation.  I had to return back home as  I couldn't find any accommodation, wasting ferry tickets etc, more importantly with very very unhappy kids. Airbnb doesn't have any control on the accommodation. Don't waste your time and money by booking through Airbnnb. Use proper hotels/holiday providers."
Ashish A Maheshwari,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1 Oct 2021,"Avoid Airbnb, pathetic customer service. Lot of properties are described wrongly and as a guest have wasted lot of time and missed out on property at last minute and Airbnb just claimed that it is host's problem and not their.... i left with no home in budget for which lot of properties were available earlier...."
Bradley Smith,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,25 Sept 2021,"After 7 years, I can no longer be an AirBnB customer.Rented a property in Bradford for 14 nights only to find after the first two nights that it was impossible for any us (3 guests) to sleep due to drag racing around the flat until 4am and loud conversations happening on the street throughout the evening. We only tried to stay the second night as a courtesy to the host.Cancelled after 30 hours and was told an AirBnB representative would contact me regarding a full refund of the remaining nights. However, they simply texted me a notice saying that, as I had not cancelled within 24 hours of check in, a full refund of the remaining nights was not possible.To summarise, this has cost us £1,200 for two nights in a flat that no one could sleep in. Shameful practice by the AirBnB host but equally shameful practice by AirBnB, retaining the entire booking fee and not fulfilling their promise to call me back.I attempted 4 times to follow up with AirBnB and each time was told that someone would call me back, only to receive a text via their app that the matter was closed. Cowardly and callous customer relations. No more."
Valerie,IE,,Updated 20 Sept 2021,"I have been hosting for a few years and did not have any problems until this year when I had to cancel some bookings due to covid 19 for the safety of my clients and my familyRecently I relisted and was welcomed back by Airbnb, I was aware there may be a penalty for cancellation but under the circumstances exceptions would be madeAirbnb did not contact me to inform me of any penalties and I happily accepted bookings, I have now hosted three times and have received nothing, no payouts, I have had some lovely people stay in my house but not a cent paid outI am warning hosts and future hosts about this despicable behaviour from Airbnb and now I have no option but to discontinue working with this underhand company"
Mel,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,18 Sept 2021,"I checked in to my accommodation. They told me there was security issues and I had to check out with no warning and no alternative place to go - for a month!!! They didn't even tell me what the security issues were. I phoned and told me they'll reimburse a night in a hotel for me. I paid for this and waiting patiently for acknowledgement of the receipt I sent them.They sent me a link to alternative accommodation...  in Madrid. I'm in Barcelona! I found alternative accommodation myself, they gave me no help or support. I phoned and messaged numerous times. I've raised a case with PayPal about receiving my refund for the original accommodation, but as for the reimbursement, I have no idea if I'll get that.They had zero concern for me, a young solo female. It is absolutely inexcusable. I'm left out of pocket because their incompetency. It's only a matter of time before they're in serious trouble."
Hassan Yousuf Saleem,GB,,14 Sept 2021,"We used airbnb to book our holiday, I would advise anyone to do this at their own risk.  We had two bookings for our holiday, considering our travel plans had already been arranged it was so frustrating to find out our second booking had been cancelled by the host a few days before we were meant to leave.  At this point all airbnb could do was to issue a refund and a coupon as a ""goodwill gesture"". They couldn't help us find another location to stay as nothing was available.Now I assume they expected us to use the coupon for the same holiday, as it has terms and conditions which stated it needed to be used on a booking equal or greater to the original booking, we couldn't use it at the time as I said there was nothing available.So we were left with a ""goodwill gesture"" that couldn't be used as it would expire in a months time and airbnb were unwilling to extend the expiry date for the coupon.  For a billion-dollar company, handing out a measly coupon with strict terms and conditions just comes across as cheap and not very friendly at all."
Luiz F. Bianchi,GB,,12 Sept 2021,"On Tuesday 31/08 I rented a ""whole place"" in airbnb to spend a couple of days near Alicante/Spain with my wife. It was by no means a cheap place and we were looking forward to it.When we got to the place, the neighbourhood was very dodgy and there were two locked doors to rooms inside the apartment, we did not feel safe in there at all.We decided to leave even before the first night and asked the host and airbnb for a refund on the unused fees (cleaning fee, service fee and remaining nights).Airbnb dodged all our requests and refused to help, even though we opened a call on the ""I do not feel safe."" button, it pretty much felt like the button is completely useless.When you try to rent a place in Airbnb it does not show you the address so you simply cannot gauge the safety of the neighbourhood, how are we supposed to be safe if:1- Airbnb does not help you when you make a call.2- Airbnb does not let you see the surroundings of the place before booking it.The one saviour was Booking.com, which got us a great accommodation on a very late time of the night (after 10pm). Having been a client of Airbnb for many years now, I feel very disappointed with the level of customer service provided, specially considering a safety matter.From now on I will think way more than twice before closing a deal with Airbnb."
Elizabeth Wilson,GB,,Updated 30 Aug 2021,"We were disappointed that there was no welcome pack in the lodge. After a horrendous journey of 12 hours, we arrived at Squirrel lodge at 8.30pm only to find that we couldn't even get a cup of tea and all local shops were closed. The double bed was not very comfortable and every time my husband turned over it creaked like mad and woke me up.A nicely located clean lodge and Charlie the host did respond quickly to messages but all other Airbnb accommodation we have used supplied tea and coffee. Maybe something to consider?"
Euvylaine Vito,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,26 Aug 2021,"Husband-to-be and I booked a property TWO MONTHS in advance to host family and friends for a day on a large estate with woods ponds In East Grinstead, West Sussex. It's unfortunate I can't enter a link here because the photos and space look absolutely amazing.Their “All about xxxxxxx'x place” boasted of being “brilliant for entertaining” and “great for family and friend reunions”, and even went as far to state in the entertainment section ' the listening can accommodate a gather of 25 or more attendess”.So we thought perfect, as most properties explicitly say if they allow house parties or not. We booked and asked the host lots of questions regarding the property's capacity insinuating we are hosting an event. The host didn't seem bothered with all the questions and never asked what we intended to do at the property.5 days before the check-in day, when all the monies had been paid, (£1300+) the Host tells us that they have had issues with house parties and that we were explicitly forbidden, the check out time had been moved earlier and the addition of CCTV had been put in place. There was no information given by them to indicate that the terms had changed or when they changed, however, we still had our booking email and most of the information, luckily we took a screenshot prior.In a concise email, we expressed the intention to have a party but not in the house on the large estate OUTSIDE with Gazebos and catering and queried if that would now be an issue. We wanted there to be no future issues and were confused about the timing of the change.The host replied with rhetoric questioning our integrity as they thought we were only bringing up what we planned to do on the estate because of the CCTV.Threatened to contact Airbnb to let them know we were intending to breach the contract and they were considering cancelling the booking without a refund.They made up some nonsense without us even replying, saying we have already breached and disrespected the contract and they want us to acknowledge receipt of the email.  Without our check-in date still, TWO days away, we couldn’t have breached a contract as we hadn’t even been to the property.At this point, we realised there was no point even replying but trying to get some clarity we did. We responded with receipts. Evidence in the change of booking screenshots emails and pictures. During the host’s replies, this is where Airbnb enters a customer services representative made us aware of their policy and our position. The host has to make sure they stick to their original check-in and check-out times, however even though they can see they have updated the listing they cannot force them to give us a full refund or host the event.This is where we are really outraged if someone cannot deliver on what is promised then you should be entitled to get a full refund, especially with all the evidence. Airbnb has really let a lot of people down. I understand they want to protect their hosts and I’m sure there are situations that warrant that. We have not entered the property and everything is really up in the air. This is not a small amount of money either £1300+ is a whole months wage even more for some for only 4 days and 3 nights. Which we were willing to pay to make some dreams come true. While still waiting for more support from Airbnb the current handling and correspondence has been lack-lustre with being passed around from different support reps through chats. We even provided them with the proof and they continued to remind us we should not breach the contract even though we have never expressed we would or haven’t been to the property.The check-in date is tomorrow and I’m really hoping this can be resolved with integrity and morality On Airbnbs part especially since the host won't address the change in contract and essentially just keeps telling us we are ""breaching the contract"" and even more recently ""we have no regard for safety and its a big issue."""
Fred,ES,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,24 Aug 2021,"Just had to return 9 days early from a much needed family holiday to visit family. Booked and paid for the accommodation 4 weeks in advance. 24 hours before check in I tried to get check in instructions but the host did not respond. We flew from Spain the following day hoping the Host would contact us before landing. 1 Hour before we were due to check in he cancelled due to alleged flea infection. This was, of course, after my free cancellation period. He told me to contact Airbnb and tell them he had cancelled due to fleas. I did this got an initial response from Airbnb but they have just not responded since. I asked the Host to contact Airbnb but he did not respond again. At the time there was very little accommodation where we needed to be and ended up for a night in an expensive hotel. During this stay I managed to find an Airbnb which was available 3 days later, I proceeded to book this accommodation. I had to wait 24 hours for conformation of the booking, which came eventually. 24 hours after receiving conformation of the booking the Host contacted me to cancel this booking, Airbnb had double booked. By this time the hotel where we had managed to book was full and we had to leave. So we had no choice but to pay for an extra flight and return home early.Through all of this Airbnb have failed to keep in touch , the host also failed with his communication. I am now £1060 out of pocket a shortened holiday, lost hire car fees and 5 nights in an expensive hotel paid. Airbnb just don't seem interested. I will never use Airbnb again but going by my experience with them they wont care less."
seth judd,GB,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,17 Aug 2021,"I've been using this site as host and also guest for 3 years. It used to be pretty good, but has gone downhill a lot in the past year with draconian new security and ID measures that are frustrating, a waste of lots of our time and a privacy issue.They also put up their commission and now take almost 21% on every booking. Greedy airbnb!"
Paul Warren,GB,,17 Aug 2021,"Shocking serviceStayed at a ruin of a place, reported it to air bnb  told it would be sorted ASAP. No response after 3 days. Wait time on phone says 5 mins, no way  at least 20 mins everythingPointless and very poor customer relations"
Martin Besant,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,15 Aug 2021,"I rented a property in Cambridge. It was a large property. Immediately upon arrival it was obvious that the property had been neglected for a long time. The grass in the back garden was approximately 1M high in places. There were long brambles strewn across the garden, which of course then led to one of my Grand Children scratching herself. We contacted someone who sent people to put it right. They made a token effort and left. There were numerous other faults from lights not working to toilets not flushing, to the TV not having an HDMI lead present. Carpets were badly stained, etc etc. I made a compaint to Airbnb immediately on my return.They did Absolutely nothing ! Furthermore they stated that as they could not contact the owner of the property that this was grounds to close my compleint !!!So BEWARE dealing with Airbnb. They do not do anything to help if there are issues ."
Emanuel Jicmon,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,2 Aug 2021,"This is such a useless application. It didn't let me change my phone number in the past and now I have a new one, I can't access my account now because they keep asking for the phone number, I can't speak to anyone over the phone cuz they ask for the phone number and no email address to speak to somone. What a waste of time and effort. I have information on that profile but can't access it because there is no customer support. Dont use this. It's a big headache and waste of time and nerves."
Natalie Pingree,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,28 Jul 2021,"If I could give this company zero stars I would. We will never book with Air b n b again. Arrived at our property to find the house unclean, stinking of dog and several safety hazards throughout the house. We spent our first night cleaning it, the fridge was absolutely filthy, dog hairs everywhere.Then washing bedding which caused us to itch as it hadn't been washed. Very long screws sticking out all over the place by the hot tub, broken bricks on the steps, garden is accessible by anyone and not secure, oven opens across the kitchen door very unsafe, several lights not working, no warning about dangerous step in the bathroom. The hosts moved out the day they started to rent the property and you can tell as it has not had a deep clean and is filthy!We drove four hours to get there and still couldn't check in on time as the hosts were still moving out of the property!On speaking to Air b n b about it (at 7p a minute!) we awaited a phonecall back with alternative accommodation. Absolutely no call back so we had to call again to chase. Then a list of accommodation sent in a message, none of which were actually available. We then got passed around to several members of staff.We therefore we had no choice but to stay. Two members of our party found a hotel to stay in but air b n b are refusing to refund for their contribution! Absolutely shocking. Never use this company again."
Angelo & Tracey Convertino,GB,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Updated 23 Jul 2021,"HI allI’m just letting you all know that if you are planning to book a break with AirbnbBEWARE.My daughter booked a large house in Wilburton near Ely for her hen party of about 20 peopleLast year once we were out of lock down and paid a deposit of £1800 between them but due to the Government changing the rules as we wet into the second lock down the party was unable to          go ahead as it would be illegal .So we asked the host if we could change the date and the host Luke Flack point blank refused and said this would be classed as a cancellation and we would lose our deposit .We asked Airbnb to sort it out and all they said was his cancellation policy stood.They have a resolution centre which consist of see the host T and C’s and in return the host said see Airbnb  T and C’ s . Eventually we had two choices ,cancel and lose £1800 or pay the next instalmentOf £1500 so as not to break the contract and then take our chances in court so we cancelled as we didn’t want to loose any more money. Airbnb said they would speak to the host to see if he would show some good will and return some of the money but he refused point blank.I asked Air bnb if they would return the booking fee of £480 and they said not this time.SO BEWARE of Air bnb they offer no protection and there tc’s are overridden by the host’s tc’cIf you are going to book a break other companies offer free change of dates and some sort of covid cover so use them.The host emailed me telling me he was entitled to keep the money and he’s a super host for Air bnb WELL he certainly is a super something but the word host doesn’t spring to mind.Theres one small conciliation and that is we all did an honest days work for our money and Luke Flack earned his through our misfortune.I’m disappointed for my daughter as this was supposed to be a special time .SO BEWARE DON’T USE Air B and B and certainly don’t book Luke Flack’s house in Wilburton as if anything changes with the covid rules and you can’t go YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEYTake care everybody Angelo Convertino."
